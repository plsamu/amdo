Automatic Markdown Organizer.

## ideas

The idea is to load a markdown in a database and make it be researchable in an easy way.
The point is to automatize this process to the point where the only thing you need to do is to upload the markdown.
For future developments, the idea is to also upload PDFs such as scientific papers.
